Z-Tree QA
=========
This is a repository containing all of the sample code I have written to answer
Z-Tree implementation questions. Detailed explanation of how each program works [can
be found in the README section the background](https://github.com/aaruff/ZTreeQuestionAnswer/blob/master/src/MultiButtonSelectionHistory.txt#L58-159).

Usage
-----------------------
To run the sample code download the project zip file, you should see a Download Zip button
to the right, and decompress it. Run Z-Tree, import the sample program your interested in 
running (File, Import...), save the imported treatment, and run it.

Contribution
------------
If you would like to make a change to an existing sample program and have your update 
reflected here, or would like to add your own QA sample program, [fork this project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/),
make your additions and changes, and [send me a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
