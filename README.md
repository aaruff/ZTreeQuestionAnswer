Z-Tree Qestion and Answer Sample Code
======================================
This is a repository containing all of the sample code I have written to answer
[Z-Tree](http://www.iew.uzh.ch/ztree/index.php) programming implementation questions. Detailed explanation of how each program works can
be found in the [sample code source directory](https://github.com/aaruff/ZTreeQuestionAnswer/blob/master/src/MultiButtonSelectionHistory), 
and in the [background of the program](https://github.com/aaruff/ZTreeQuestionAnswer/blob/master/src/MultiButtonSelectionHistory/MultiButtonSelectionHistory.txt#L58-159).

Usage
-----------------------
To run the sample code download the project zip file, there should be a Download ZIP button
to the right of this text. Once the project file has been decompressed you can find all of
the example source program directories in the src directory. To run the sample program 
Start Z-Tree, import the sample program (File, Import...), save it (File, Save), and run it (Run, Start Treatment).
