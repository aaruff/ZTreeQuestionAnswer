Z-Tree QA
=========
This is a repository containing all of the sample code I have written to answer
Z-Tree implementation questions. Detailed explanation of how each program works [can
be found in the README section the background](https://github.com/aaruff/ZTreeQuestionAnswer/blob/master/src/MultiButtonSelectionHistory.txt#L58-159).

Usage
-----------------------
To run the sample code import the source.txt file into Z-Tree (File, Import...), save the treatment, and run it.

Questions
---------

> How do I record the order in which a set of buttons are selected in Z-Tree for 2 or more buttons on a screen?
